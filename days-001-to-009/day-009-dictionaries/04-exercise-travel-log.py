#         "country": location,
#         "visits": count,

#     print(f"You've visited {location} {count} times.")
#     print(f"You've been to {visited[0]} and {visited[1]}.\n")

# Method 2: Create a new dictionary and append it to the list:

    new_country["country"] = location
    new_country["visits"] = count
