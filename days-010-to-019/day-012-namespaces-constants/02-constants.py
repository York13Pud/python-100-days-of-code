# Global constants are variables that you define that will not ever change.
# To define a constant in python, you name the variable using only uppercase charecters. For example:

PI = 3.14159
print(PI + 1)

# NOTE: This is just a naming practice. You can actually change the value of an uppercase variable but it is
# bad practice to do so.
