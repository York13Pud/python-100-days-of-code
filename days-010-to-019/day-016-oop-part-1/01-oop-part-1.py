# So far I have been doing procedural -based programming, meaning that functions are setup and relate only by passing data to
# the next function / procedure. This can become very complex.

# OOP makes scaling code easier. Think of it like a manager with staff that perform different roles.
# An object, in this example, a waiter (the model) will have certain criteria (attributes (such as variables)) and perform certain actions (methods (such as functions)).

# See oop-model-example image for an example using a waiter for the model

# Once the model (a waiter) has been modeled, we call this a class (blueprint). A class can be reused many times to create
# multiple objects (in this case, multiple waiters).

# see oop-class-object image for an example.

# Classes should start with a capital letter.
