Two rules for creating API's:
1. Use HTTP request verb. The verbs are:
   - GET
   - POST
   - PUT
   - PATCH
   - DELETE
2. Use specific pattern of routes / enpoint URL's.
   - Put simply, make the routes make sense. For example /movies/<moviename>

Serialisation is the process of converting the results of a SQL query into a JSON format that can be returned.

PUT replaces an existing entry with a complete rewrite of the existing record. Typically, you change one 
thing (maybe more) but the entire record is updated.

PATCH only updates the field in the record where the data changes. Much more efficient.
